# AR Multiplayer Monsters Card Game
This is a multiplayer augmented reality mobile game (Android). This was done as part of a University project.

To play the game, it is needed to create a build for an Android device, following instructions at https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-BuildProcess.html

Main highlighs of this project:
1. Creating and joining a multiplayer game lobby.
2. Scanning physical cards and projecting objects on top of them.
3. Using a networking system that sends messages between players.
